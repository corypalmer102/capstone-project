This is a Wordle-style word guessing gane built in Python using the Rich library for coloured terminal output.

Players select a category, attempt to guess a hidden 5-letter word in 5 tries, and receive colour-coded feedback after each guess.

Features implemented: Wordle-style 6x5 grid display, coloured feedback (green: correct letter & correct position, yellow: correct letter but wrong position, grey: letter not present), multiple word categories (animals, jobs, countries, feelings, food, vehicles, random).

Requirements: Python 3.9+, Rich library.

How to run: 

Go to the project directory in Terminal: cd ~/Desktop/Capstone\ Project

Run the program: python3 main.py

I plan to add: timer mode, streak counter, win/loss statistics, multiple difficulty levels.
